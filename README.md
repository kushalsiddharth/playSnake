# playSnake
basic snake game

In this project, you can play the popular “Snake Game” just like you played it elsewhere. 
You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake. 
Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. 
Every time the snake eats the food, its length will be increased by one element along with the “f” it feeds by itself.
